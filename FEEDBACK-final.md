# Final feedback

## Overall score: 9/10

It's been exciting to see how much you have all learned about stock markets,
trading, and machine learning! The fact that you weren't able to make money
didn't come as a surprise, but it did seem to take the wind out of your sails a
bit. Still, I hope you will come back to this subject later in life and build
on this foundation. I'm looking forward to reading research papers from you on
how AI should manage our economy.

## Things you can do to become better at group collaboration

* Some of you wrote stuff but never merged it in to main! (Alex, Angus, Robert)
* Some of you need to curate your commits to avoid extraneous entries. (Aidan)

## Specific callouts

* Alex, your doc was excellent, but it looks like you didn't do anything after
  writing it? In a perfect world, you could used your insight as a springboard
  to unleash the next wave of innovation!
* Angus, your activity often seemed disconnected from what the rest of the
  group was doing. A longer-term growth area for you is to realize that
  software engineering is a social activity and you need to plug yourself into
  the mainstream of what the group is doing rather than having your own side
  projects.
* Eamon, I'm glad to see you checked some things in, but your overall output
  was quite low? I also had a hard time determining which commits were from
  you, so let me know if lots of the "=" commits are yours and I overlooked
  them.
* Kelyan, what happened? It looks like you haven't done anything at all since
  sprint 2??
