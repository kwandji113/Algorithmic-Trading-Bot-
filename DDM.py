#TODO figure out how i can get all of the information i need from the ticker function for yFinance and then implement 2 main methods that will return the DDM calculation with 2 diff parameters
#one that is set on a day and another that is set on a timeframe ie. one that just gives me the day and another that gives me a time over a period
#for me that will matter less because the calculation is still going to be the same, i just need to get the data based on a diff time period.
