# Feedback on sprint 1

## Some useful git commands
I used these commands to get a quick read on what everyone did. Then I delved into specific files for a closer look.
* git log --all --graph --oneline --pretty=format:"%C(auto)%<|(20,trunc)%an%<(10)%h%<(60,trunc)%s%d"
* git log --all --numstat --oneline --author <author>

## Overall score: 10/10

You all have learned a lot about this space! Now you know about:
* Scraping stock market data
* Ways to train neural networks on time series data
* Ideas for how to measure neural network performance on time series data
* The difficulty of beating the market
That's great progress for just a couple of months!

## Specific callouts

* Alex, your work stood out in several ways. It was impressive how quickly you got your neural network up and running,
  and how quickly you pivoted once you understood that your seemingly good predictions were actually meaningless.
  Your document is likewise impressive. Keep up the good learning!
* For those of you doing technical indicators, see how soon you can integrate them into the overall stock picker!
  It's good that you have some things written, but you're barely scratching the surface until you tie it into an
  end-to-end system.
* Angus, make sure you don't get stuck doing only data scraping! It's an important aspect of the project, but you
  should also make sure you're gaining knowledge in other areas.
* Eamon, I'm assuming you're the one who submitted code as "=". Your code contribution is non-zero (yay!) but still
  too small. Find ways to get involved in the heart of the project and get more code written!
  (Your score adjusted -2 to 8/10).
