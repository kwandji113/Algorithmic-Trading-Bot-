# Algorithmic-Trading-Bot
by Nathan, Kelyan, Aidan, Eamon, Robert, Alex and Angus

Rough Project Overview:




4-Month Timeline:
Checkpoint 1: Clear vision on what we want to do. Subject to change but a finished architecture diagram, research on algorithms, stock market, and neural networks done. Experimentation code on which technical indicators to use, api usage to get stock market data, and what data libraries we want to use. Essentially figuring out the logistical backbone of the project. 

Checkpoint 2: Should have some base-level neural network and algorithm working. Some sort of base-level UI done. Get the project to a state where data from a timeframe can be fed into the algorithms we have and we can return results whether the stock will trend up or down. Tested our algorithm with real-world data to educate decisions on how to adjust and improve.

Checkpoint 3: Neural network and algorithm should be very refined (95% done) where only fine tuning is needed. Interactable UI. Can feed longer timeframe into algorithms while still having positive results.

Checkpoint 4: Completely finished project, math and neural network completely done, functional, and working together to provide information on when to buy, sell, etc.
UI done and at minimum
