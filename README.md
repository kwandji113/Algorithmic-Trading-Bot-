# Algorithmic-Trading-Bot
by Nathan, Kelyan, Aidan, Eamon, Robert, Alex and Angus

Rough Project Overview:
We are making an algorithmic trading bot. Using some complex math and a trained neural network to perform sentiment analysis, we are going to create an algorithm that should be able to predict the growth or decay of stocks with some reliability. Right now this will be a program that a user can download and be able to run on their computer. It should provide information on when to buy a stock and when to sell. We might be able to get the program to a point where we can handle the buying and selling of assets within the program. 



4-Month Timeline:
Checkpoint 1: Clear vision on what we want to do. Subject to change but a finished architecture diagram, research on algorithms, stock market, and neural networks done. Experimentation code on which technical indicators to use, api usage to get stock market data, and what data libraries we want to use. That also means code that can organize the data we pull into a processable format. Figure out the training for the first neural network. Look into parallel computing to train the neural networks faster. 

Checkpoint 2: Should have some base-level neural network and algorithm working. Some sort of base-level UI done. Get the project to a state where data from a timeframe can be fed into the algorithms we have and we can return results whether the stock will trend up or down. Tested our algorithm with real-world data to educate decisions on how to adjust and improve.

Checkpoint 3: Neural network and algorithm should be very refined (95% done) where only fine tuning is needed. Interactable UI. Can feed longer timeframe into algorithms while still having positive results.

Checkpoint 4: Completely finished project, math and neural network completely done, functional, and working together to provide information on when to buy, sell, etc.
UI done and at minimum
