## Why does Angus have 0 lines of code committed for sprint 2?

TLDR: For project 2, our group's strategy was to try as many ideas on the Neural Network side as possible. After spending 2 of the 3 weeks on my Neural Network, I realized that my strategy was not viable due to a lack of low-cost data.

Long answer: At the start of sprint 2, we still weren't sure about how to make the neural network, and it became the primary bottle neck of the project. We decided to have everyone work on their own neural network to try as many things as possible. 

After some work on my model, it was clear that there was an overfitting issue. I decided to differentiate my model from the rest of the group by trying to find more detailed data. At this point, I had already created an automatic scraper for Yahoo finance, however it didn't provide much data more precise than daily.

2 main issues were found:

1. Most data I found was locked behind a paywall.

2. Data freely available was inaccurate.

For the 1st problem, there wasn't much I could think of to solve that problem - we had no money.

The 2nd problem ate up much more of my time. I sourced the data from Kaggle, Upwork, etc. It was only until I began cleaning up the data did I realize that much of the data was labeled with the wrong date or flat out didn't exist.

At this point, I need to move on to keep the project moving. I will now be working on a testing framework.
